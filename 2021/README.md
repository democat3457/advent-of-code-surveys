# The Unofficial Advent of Code 2021 Survey

This folder contains the results for the 2021 (unofficial) Advent of Code Survey.

## TODO

List of things to do for the 2021 dashboard:

- Add more preprocessing based off the grouping logic in PowerBI versions from previous years
- Add accessible descriptions of all charts
- Remove 2021 gitignore and add sanitized results
- Create tiny build script to generate /docs folder
- Set up github pages to show the results

Optional:

- Participation timing for *all* years
- Cross-tables for language and IDE and such
- Include highlights or specials for each year
- Fix spelling mistake in sanitized files
- Figure out how to use horizontal bar charts to show more items
